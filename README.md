## Raspi Power Strip

Hi, and thanks for looking at my project! This is an open source project, so feel free to adapt anything you see for your own applications.

### What this is: 
A Node.js server that controls a smart power strip. By wiring a Raspberry Pi Zero to five relays housed inside a power strip, this software runs a server on the local network with an API and website to switch each of the outlets on or off. 

Furthermore, this readme will document my build process and what it takes to set up a Raspi Power Strip of your own.
